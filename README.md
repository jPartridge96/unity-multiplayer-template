# Unity Multiplayer Template
Skeleton for a multiplayer project using Multiplayer Sessions and Relay inside Unity 6 (6000.0.33f1).

This is a preconfigured project using [Multiplayer Widgets](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.multiplayer.widgets@1.0/manual/get-started-learn-widgets.html) package, built off of the [Small Scale Competitive Multiplayer](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.template.multiplayer-ngo@2.1/manual/index.html) template from Unity. The extension adds additional UI and a cleaner folder structure to begin development. The goal of this project is to help introduce developers who are new to multiplayer development get their project brought to life faster.
